  <h2 id="what-happened">What Happened</h2>

<p>Over the course of a semester, I along with six others were tasked with converting a website for the Hawaii Annual Coding Challenge or Hacc. To do this, we had to go through all the pages and
convert the pages from semantic ui to use bootstrap5 instead. Additionally, we were tasked with implementing a function in order to completely wipe the database of the site in order to more easily
reuse the site should it be needed once again in the future.</p>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>

<p>In short, the best thing that we were able to accomplish as a team was that we were for the most part, able to accomplish the task that was given to us for the project having converted to my knowledge, most if not all of the pages were successfully converted to BootStrap5 from semantic UI, however on the issue of adding the ability to dump the database, I am not too sure as to
the progress on that front as I was not the one to try and implement it. Additionally, having to work together as a team in my opinion gave me a greater understanding on how it is to work as a team and the challenges that stem from everyone in a group having to work together to accomplish something.</p>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>

<p>One of the major problems that I say that our group had was that we did not really have a definitive leader to keep everyone working on their tasks. Also due to the nature of the class, for the most part we had few meetings every week with only 3 falling on monday, wednesday and friday. Additionally, due to some issues with how our github project was set up, we had some issues that had multiple people working on them without knowing due to having some issues that were repeated.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>In the end, I think that while the process of working together was marred by some hiccups in our organization and a lack of a clear leader, we were able to form a relatively cohesive team that accomplished most of what we set out to do. Though I would not say that it was a stunning performance of teamwork, we still did in fact work together and we did put together a semi-viable product. Additionally, I would say that this experience was a good one to learn about working together as a team and the challenges that crop up during such an endeavor.</p>
