In the process of doing the JavaScript practice problems I found that I had to relearn a lot of things. While most of the problems were similar to what I learned in the past, I had forgotten some things in regards to coding due to not having done it in some time. For instance, I had forgotten how to construct objects and how to mess with the properties of those objects. As such it took me a bit to relearn how to do so. Additionally, unlike with Java, I found that JavaScript is much more user  friendly in a way as it lets you easily manipulate variables in contrast to java in which I felt like everything was difficult. While I had not encountered JavaScript before this class, I found that my experience coding in c and vim was able to make it easier to adapt to the, to me, "new" coding language. Additionally, I found that many tasks were easier to implement in JavaScript as it was much less iffy about the details, such as not requiring the user to specify what type of variable they were actually creating, thus in my perspective, I think that JavaScript is a pretty good programming language. 
While I do think that it is easier to program in JavaScript, the thought of having to program quickly is extremely stressful. The problem that I find with the idea of athletic software engineering is that I do not believe that under pressure, I will be able to come up with a solution to the problem as that is probably what will take me longer to do than implementing the idea itself.
