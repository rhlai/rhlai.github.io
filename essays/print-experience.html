<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>In my pursuit to get a degree in Computer Science at UH Manoa, I took a class called ICS 314: Software Engineering. In this class, I was able to experience web development and learned about how to work
together in a group. While there were what I would say are the main topics that were covered, there were a few smaller ones that we went over that I found to stick out to me a little. These were mainly, coding standards,
and ethics in software engineering. As such, I would like to dive deeper into these topics.</p>

<h2 id="coding-standards">Coding Standards</h2>

<p>Previously I had written about coding standards and how they had, for the most part, been quite a nuisance to me due to them being a distraction. While my viewpoint has not changed much regarding this when coding for myself, or without thinking that anyone will have to look at my code, I have found that it affects my coding when I work with others. 
While working with others, I would find myself very often reading the code of my peers in order to gain insight into what it is they were trying to write so that I could a) integrate it with my code, or b) correct or
use what they had when working on our group project. Having a set coding standard made it so that the code for the most part was not very obfuscated and was overall, easier to read. Though it would have helped if
everyone decided to also comment on that code, as would conform with standards, not everyone did, and I cannot say that I had. Overall, while I still am not that big of a fan of coding standards, I can understand their importance and use cases.</p>

<h2 id="ethics-in-software-engineering">Ethics in Software Engineering</h2>

<p>One of the last topics that we covered in ICS 314 and also one of the shortest topics was ethics. Is it ethical to use people’s data without their consent and their knowledge to better
serve the user? That was a question that we had to answer and argue against one day in class. While the topic was short, and the discussion even shorter, I found it to be a very meaningful question with all the news about
data leaks, Facebook data collection scandals, and other online controversies are quite a recent phenomena. While I think that those that forfeit their data to companies should be fully aware of the ramifications of what that entails, I also cannot expect people to understand how any of their data is being used. 
Every company will have terms of service that they provide when you sign up for their service, and almost everyone will merely scroll through it and click accept. Nearly no one takes the time to read through the hundreds of words stating everything that one could need to know about the service as nearly no one has that keen an eye to care. While the way that data was used in Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica controversy was abhorrent,
the way the data was being used was most likely already stated in the terms of service. Thus I find that the need to be ethical in software engineering goes further than just having the developer decide what is ethical,
but rather to put the onus on the user. By having the terms of service not be a long and contrived document flooded with legalize and clauses, but rather a summary of all the points listed and an additional addendum to the full document should a user want to know more, many of the problemproblems regarding data collection could be solved. In the digital age, there is no way to fully discount the prevalence of data and the need to collect it, thus we must find a middle ground in which people’s data and privacy is protected, while also being accessible to developers to better serve the user.</p>
