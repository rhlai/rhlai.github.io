<h2 id="what-is-a-coding-standard">What Is a Coding Standard?</h2>

<p>Coding standards are a set of rules that are used when writing code in order to make it more legible to those that might have to read it in the future. By adhering to some form of coding standard, one is able to partially unpack what exactly is happening in the code when given the coding style. Moreover the adoption of a coding style means that variables and other functions are more legible and not all over the place.</p>

<h2 id="my-experience-with-coding-standards">My Experience with Coding Standards</h2>

<p>In the process of taking ICS 314, we had to follow a coding style for the class which was achieved through the use of ES Lint. This however was not the first time that I have been exposed to coding styles due to having taken various other computer science and coding courses in the past. The problem that has cropped up however is the conflicting coding styles that are prevalent between multiple classses that have partly made it harder for me to adapat to this new style. This is mostly mitigated by the use of ES Lint as it does inform me of when I are not within the bounds of the coding style, I find that it sometimes can detract from my ability to code.
This is due to various factors such as not always knowing when ES Lint is running, causing me to only get errors regarding the style once I notice it at the end, or when it refuses to let me use let to create a variable as I do not change it’s value. While I can understand that if I will not be changing the variable, that I should use const to protect my variables, I can never be sure that I will not try to change it’s value. Additionally, I found myself being constantly distracted by the red error marks that would pop up while working with ES Lint.</p>

<h2 id="pros-to-coding-standards">Pros to Coding Standards</h2>

<p>While I am unable to say that I very much like having to completely adhere to these coding standards, I will not discount it’s ability to make my code much more legible than without it. Additionally, with the use of ES Lint’s integrated fix capability, it is much less noticeable when I am trying to code as it will for the most part fix any problems with spacing on it’s own.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>In general, I cannot say that I hate having to use coding standards or that it gets in the way, but I cannot also say that it is extremely useful for the sake of learning a coding language.</p>
