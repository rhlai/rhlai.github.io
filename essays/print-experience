## Overview

What is a UI Framework?
UI Frameworks are essentially a toolkit that can be used by a web developer who knows of it in order to more easily make a website. While there is a learning curve 
from what I have experienced so far working with Bootstrap 5, I can say that it makes many tasks easier, but also make some things harder to grasp.

UI vs Raw HTML
I found that using bootstrap made many tasks easier, but it also somewhat pushed me into relying on it extensively rather than trying to figure out ho
w to make it work without it. Additionally, I found that some tasks were made extremely hard to do as I could not easily find documentation on it. An exa
mple of this is working with dropdown menus in Bootstrap. By default, the dropdown menus present in bootstrap 5 requires one to click them to activate them. 
While it is possible to change this through the css, I found it incredibly hard to do so as I could not find a easy way to do it. Additionally, there were tim
es where I grew increasingly frustrated with working with images in bootstrap as I could not figure out how to make elements overlap one another and even afte
r hours could not figure it out.

Using Bootstrap
Though at times I found it frustrating to use, I cannot play down the benefits of using bootstrap. It made formatting webpages easier, made it much easier to 
make a navigation bar, made aligning images a breeze aswell as made many tasks easier. Actually having learned it made it possible for me to make a website f
or another class that I am taking this semester.
