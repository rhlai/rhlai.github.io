Rate My Bathroom - Dustin Tomi, Payton Higa, Raymond Li, Nicolas Steger
Overview
Problem : Bathrooms open and close at different times. They also greatly vary in cleanliness and accessibility. It can be impossible to know which bathroom to go to when you are pressed for time.

Solution : Rate My Bathroom. A Meteor Application that lists bathrooms near you with their opening and closing times. It also has ratings from individual users on their experience using select bathrooms.
