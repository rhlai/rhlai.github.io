<h2 id="The Gameplay">The Gameplay</h2>

The game is centered on the player character you control that is a cat, the object of the game is to cause as much destruction and mayhem in the small countryside village the game is based in. With a time limit commit as much destruction as possible, the player can swipe, pounce and interact with various objects to cause destruction. The end goal is to score as many points as possible and eventually be given a score from 1-10.

Currently, all that exists of the project is ideas and an initial storyboard of the game. As such there is not much to currently show and even less that can be said about the game.
