<h2 id="How it Started">How it Started</h2>

When I was a kid I was enrolled into cub scouts, making many friends along the way and learning many skills. 

<h2 id="How it Ended">How it Ended</h2>

By the end of my journey in boy scouts, I had achieved the rank of Heart Scout, the rank just under that of Eagle Scout which is the highest rank. While I did not manage to ultimately achieve the final rank, I was able to go far in my journey and done many things that I never knew I would be capable of. 

<h2 id="What I Learned">What I Learned</h2>

In the course of my scouting journey, I learned many things, from starting a fire, to pitching a tent, to learning various things like sculpting, archery and how to safely use a firearm.
