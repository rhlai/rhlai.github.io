Ninja jump was a game made by Patima Poochai, Alex Jones, and me in 2018 during our semester taking ICS 111 with Jason Leigh. The game was heavily inspired by the game doodle jump, a mobile game in which you control a bug like creature and shoot upwards at enemies while perpetually bouncing on various platforms.
